        The shake of the earth refused to be ceased.<br>
        The clouds made of ash follow up ahead,<br>
        As if tracing where a flock of swallows drifted over head.<br>
        Im begging for a future to exist,<br>
        With hands full of hope and pride that I stitched<br>
        I plead to the stars shining in the night<br>
        But Im met with a reflection of your eyes inside that light. <br>
        If I could hold your hand, say I love you then <br>
        I could kill these dreams that has never come to fruition <br>
        As all your your functions slow an abnormal heat <br>
        Slowly starts to show all across your whole nervous system <br>
        No, this cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This cant be real <br>
        This is too painful to be real life <br>
        Sounds that you try to scream dont make any sense <br>
        Coming out of your throat since it has become so infected <br>
        Hanging above a chair is a crescent moon <br>
        Rotted and deranged laughing at the way you're affected <br>
        Now it is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting close <br>
        It is getting closer <br>
        It is getting closer and closer to you. </p>
